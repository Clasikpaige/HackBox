**Penetration Testing Toolbox**

Repository Name: `Hackbox-testing`

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of tools, payloads, and scripts designed for penetration testing purposes. It aims to provide ethical hackers with a comprehensive set of resources for assessing the security of web applications and conducting various types of penetration testing.

## Contents

The repository includes the following items:

1. **SQL Injection Payloads**
   - This section contains ten SQL injection payloads that can be used to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in target applications.

2. **Blind SQL Injection Payloads**
   - Here, you'll find ten blind SQL injection payloads to assist in testing applications that may be vulnerable to this type of attack.

3. **XSS Payloads (Cross-Site Scripting)**
   - This section offers ten XSS payloads for evaluating and validating the presence of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

4. **Encoded XSS Payload**
   - Included is an encoded XSS payload that can be used to bypass input filters or security mechanisms that attempt to prevent XSS attacks.

5. **Login Vulnerabilities**
   - In this section, you will find ideas and concepts for identifying login vulnerabilities in web applications. These serve as a starting point for further exploration and the development of targeted tests.

6. **Exploiting File Upload Functionality**
   - Learn tactics and strategies for exploiting file upload functionality in web applications, enabling you to understand potential vulnerabilities and their impact.

7. **Subdomain Discovery with Bash Script**
   - This section contains a bash script that utilizes the subfinder tool to discover subdomains. The script prompts the user for a target and saves the resulting live subdomains to a file.
